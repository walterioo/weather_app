 Weather App

A small weather app I created in Python that prompts the user for a city. If the city is found, it will display the current weather conditions.

It uses the OpenWeather API. An account and API key are required.

## Instructions

Install the `requests` module:
```bash
pip install requests
```
Install `python-dotenv` module:
```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```
Create an .env file:
```bash
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```
